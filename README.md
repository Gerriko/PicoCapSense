# PicoCapSense

## An Arduino Capacitive Sensing library for RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico) boards, using the PIO processor.

### Capacitive Sensing is used to detect touch based on the electrical capacitance of the human body.


This library is based on the measuring methods used in the Capacitive Sensing Library for 'duino / Wiring (sampling method differs)
